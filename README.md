## What's This All About?

Welcome! This repo is where I'm documenting my journey through the Advent of Code 2025 challenges along with solutions

I'm not just here to collect stars (though that's fun too!). My main goal is to really learn more from the algorithms and the math behind the solutions. It's a great excuse for me to sharpen my data structure skills and write some clean, modular Python code, as well as help anyone stuck :D.

## How It's Organized

I like to keep things tidy! Each day gets its own little folder with everything you need: the source code, the puzzle input, and a markdown file where I explain my thinking.

```

/
├── Day_01/
│   ├── solution.py       # The code
│   ├── input.txt         # The puzzle input
│   └── analysis.md       # My notes on how it works
├── Day_02/
│   ├── solution.py
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── analysis.md
├── utils.py              # Helpful stuff I use a lot
└── README.md

## My Strategy

Here's how I usually tackle these:

**Part 1:** I usually just try to get the right answer as simply as possible.  
**Part 2:** This is where the fun starts! I often have to refactor things to make them faster, using tricks like dynamic programming or memoization.

I try to stick to standard Python libraries (like `itertools` or `collections`) so you don't need to install extra dependencies.

## Progress Log

## Want to Run It?

Easy peasy! Just hop into the day's folder and run the script. Make sure `input.txt` is in there too.

```bash
cd Day_02
python solution.py
